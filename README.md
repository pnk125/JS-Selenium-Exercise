Note: Creating page objects isn't a requirement and may take more time than we have. Feel free to discuss at the end how you would implement page objects.

In any way you would like. Write code to perform as many of the following actions that you can:

Open google.com  
Check that the google logo is visible  
Check there are two options present: "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky"  
Enter text "PayPal" and click "I'm Feeling Lucky"  
Check the url is now "https://www.paypal.com/"  
Click "Sitemap"  
Check the url is now "https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/full-sitemap"  
Store all of the links on this page into a list and then print them all to system.out
